# PetMyProductivity (I'm still working on it n.n!)
My final project for Alterna Academy is designed to help you boost your productivity in a fun and engaging way. Ever struggled with staying productive? This app is here to help by giving you a virtual pet to care for. Each time you complete a daily task, you earn coins to buy food and decorate your petâ€™s room. Make productivity more rewarding while creating a cozy space for your furry friend.
